# Character Development Methodology — 00b: Clarification Protocol

**Purpose:** the companion piece to `00a_Initial_Input.md`. Even with a complete character-folder pointer and a
good vision statement, the Derivation Protocol won't always produce a confident answer for every one of Stage
1's necessary fields — and *which* fields turn out ambiguous is different for every character, unpredictable
in advance. This file is not a fixed list of follow-up questions. It's a repeatable **algorithm** for finding
the smallest possible set of genuinely necessary clarifying questions for any given character, so that
resolving ambiguity stays as cheap as the initial intake was designed to be — not a second full review pass
that quietly reintroduces the large-cast workload `00a` exists to avoid.

---

## The Problem, Stated Precisely

The Derivation Protocol (`00a`) produces a full draft Stage 1 sheet by combining the seed fields with existing
folder materials, setting canon, and inference. Some of that sheet will be solid. Some of it will be a genuine
guess. **The failure mode this file exists to prevent is treating both the same way** — either dumping the
entire derived sheet back to the developer for review (defeating the compression `00a` was built for), or
silently asserting every inferred field as settled fact (risking real downstream damage when a wrong guess
propagates through Stages 2-5). Neither is acceptable at any real production scale.

---

## Step 1: Confidence-Tag Every Derived Field

Before anything gets surfaced to the developer, every field in the draft Stage 1 sheet gets one of four tags —
this tagging is the whole mechanism the rest of this protocol runs on.

- **SOURCED** — read directly from the character folder, a prior note, or existing setting canon. Not a guess
  at all. Never surfaced for clarification.
- **STRONG INFERENCE** — confidently derived from the vision statement plus setting canon, with little real
  ambiguity. Example: a vision statement reading "she's a bitter ex-soldier who never talks about her old
  unit" makes "her Ghost involves losing people under her command" a strong inference even without a stated
  cause. Reported in the final sheet with its reasoning shown, but not surfaced as a question — the developer
  can correct it later if it's ever wrong, but it doesn't block anything now.
- **WEAK INFERENCE** — multiple plausible answers exist and nothing in the seed material points clearly to
  one, *or* the field is load-bearing enough (see Step 3) that guessing wrong would cause real downstream
  damage. Continuing the example above: *why* she lost them (combat failure, internal betrayal, her own choice
  to abandon them) is genuinely underdetermined by "never talks about her old unit" alone, and this specific
  fact is exactly what Stage 3's Lie/Flaw node gets built from — a wrong guess here doesn't just mis-color one
  field, it mis-shapes everything downstream of Ghost. This tier is the primary candidate for actual
  clarification.
- **BLOCKED** — a necessary field with no signal at all to infer from, not even weakly. Also a candidate for
  clarification, unless a safe default applies (Step 2).

Optional (Section B) fields never get this treatment at all — per `00a`'s own rule, they're either read from
the folder, lightly inferred, or left blank, and blank is always an acceptable terminal state for an optional
field.

---

## Step 2: The Three-Part Surfacing Test

A field only gets raised as an actual clarification question if **all three** of the following are true:

1. **It's a necessary field**, not an optional one. Optional fields never generate a question, regardless of
   confidence tag — an unfilled optional field blocks nothing, by definition.
2. **Its confidence tag is WEAK INFERENCE or BLOCKED.** SOURCED and STRONG INFERENCE fields are never
   surfaced.
3. **No safe default exists.** Several necessary fields already have an established fallback that makes
   clarification unnecessary even when genuinely uncertain — Intended Story Role defaults to "fully-developed
   principal character, base story" per `00a`'s own protocol; World-Context Reference Access, Standing
   Design-Law Constraints, and Existing Memory/Prior Notes aren't per-character developer decisions at all;
   Existing Narrative Introduction Context, the full Relationship Web, and Existing Arc/Ending Concepts
   are deliberately deferred (TBD) at this stage regardless of confidence, since they're Stage 4/5 territory
   not needed until her actual arc development begins. None of these ever generate a clarification question,
   no matter how uncertain the underlying inference is — they get the default or the TBD tag and move on.

What survives this filter is usually a short list: typically core nature/type if the folder didn't make it
obvious, the personality-type assignment if the vision statement didn't strongly imply one, Ghost-adjacent
history if the vision statement was thin, and occasionally the place-of-origin proposal if two genuinely
different placements both fit equally well.

---

## Step 3: Prioritize by Downstream Leverage, Then Cap

If more than a small handful of fields survive Step 2's filter for one character, rank them by how many
downstream nodes and tools actually depend on getting that field right, and lead with the highest-leverage
ones:

- **The personality-type assignment** ranks highest — the typing system's own internal logic means Stage 2's
  entire diagnostic pass is run *against* this assignment; a wrong type doesn't just mis-color her, it
  mis-directs every technique applied afterward.
- **Ghost (backstory wound)** ranks second — directly feeds Lie/Flaw, Desire/Motive, Greatest Fear, and the
  Coping/Defense Mechanism tier (all Stage 3 nodes), and is the specific input Stage 5's Black-Moment-style
  climax construction needs to land correctly.
- **Core nature/type** ranks third, in any setting where it actually varies — gates whether an entire body of
  species/embodiment-specific reference material applies at all.
- Everything else that survives Step 2 ranks below these three in practice, since most other necessary fields
  either have partial safe defaults or feed a narrower slice of downstream work.

**If the ranked list is still long for a particular character, ask about the top 2-3 and let the rest default
to "propose a value and flag it clearly as a proposal"** rather than asking about everything that's merely
uncertain. A flagged proposal that turns out wrong later is cheap to fix; a blocked pipeline waiting on many
answered questions per character, across an entire cast, is not.

---

## Step 4: Phrase the Surviving Questions Efficiently

- **Prefer closed-form questions over open-ended ones.** A multiple-choice question with 3-4 concrete options
  takes seconds to answer; an open "tell me more about her backstory" prompt re-introduces exactly the writing
  burden this whole `00a`/`00b` system exists to eliminate.
- **Always include a "you decide" / "propose one for me" option**, consistent with `00a`'s own established
  precedent for the personality-type and place-of-origin fields. This should be the easy, low-effort default
  answer available on every question this protocol generates.
- **Batch every surviving question for one character into a single pass.** Never resolve them one at a time
  across multiple interruptions — gather the full surviving list from Steps 2-3, present all of it together,
  and let the developer clear a given character's ambiguity in one sitting.

**Worked contrast, using the ex-soldier example from Step 1:**
- *Bad*: "Can you tell me more about her military backstory?" — open-ended, no bound on effort required,
  exactly what this protocol exists to avoid.
- *Good*: "Her Ghost — what actually happened to her unit: (a) lost them in a failure she blames herself for,
  (b) lost them to a betrayal from within her own ranks, (c) survived by abandoning them, and that's the
  wound, (d) something else, brief description, (e) you decide, I'll propose one." Bounded, fast to answer,
  and the "you decide" option means even this doesn't strictly require engagement if the developer would
  rather move on.

---

## Step 5: Record, Re-Tag, and Finalize

Once the surviving questions are answered (or deferred to "you decide" and proposed), every resolved field
gets re-tagged SOURCED (directly from the developer's answer) or, for a "you decide" resolution, STRONG
INFERENCE (now anchored by explicit developer permission to propose, rather than an unprompted guess). The
deliberately deferred fields (introduction context, the full relationship web, ending concepts) stay marked
TBD, unchanged — they were never part of this clarification pass and don't need to be.

**Once this step completes, Stage 1 is considered locked for this character** — the full sheet, with every
field either sourced, strongly inferred, or explicitly deferred, is ready to feed Stage 2's diagnostic
toolkit. No field should still be carrying a WEAK INFERENCE or BLOCKED tag at this point; if one is, it means
Steps 2-3's filter missed something load-bearing, and that's worth fixing in this protocol itself, not just
for the one character in front of it.

---

## Step 6: Track Recurring Gap Patterns (lightweight, closes the loop back to `00a`)

If the same *kind* of gap keeps surfacing across many different characters — for example, if some particular
field keeps landing as BLOCKED because vision statements rarely happen to mention it — that's a signal worth
keeping visible, since it suggests `00a`'s own seed-field design (specifically, what the vision-statement
prompt nudges toward mentioning) could be tuned to close that gap at the source, rather than this protocol
having to keep resolving the same category of ambiguity one character at a time. Not something to act on
after a single occurrence — but worth noting when a pattern becomes clear, as a candidate revision to
`00a_Initial_Input.md` itself.
